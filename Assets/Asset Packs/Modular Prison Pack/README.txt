PBR Modular Prison V1.0

Changelog

- Initial release

About

The PBR Modular Prison pack is designed to allow rapid development of small cell type environments as part of a larger scene.  The pack includes 4 prefabs that can be snapped or positioned together to create sealed cells.  Also included are a set of hooks, manacles and spikes that can be used to decorate the cells.

Installation

- Drop the asset pack into your existing.
- If using defined tags or layers for the assets, you will need to modify these and apply to the prefabs.
- All prefabs should work via drag and drop and were designed around 0,0,0 world space.
- If you have any issues or would like to modify the scene, please read the notes below.

Notes

- The scale of the assets was designed primarily for a first person view.  It is suitable for a third person perspective, but if you find the scene feels too large or the perspective feels wrong, it is recommended to reduce the scale of all assets in this pack by one-third.

- As a result of the scale of these assets, the prison prefabs may not snap to the desired location using grid snapping and may need to be placed using vertex snapping or by hand if reducing the snap size is ineffective.

- The door prefabs are set up with correct pivots and collision to act as doors but the pack does not include a door script and by default they are set as non-static and the sample scene has preset door angles.

- While you can make any size prison using this set, it is not recommended to use it too heavily as the modular sections are quite poly dense and only cover 1.5m on x / z axes, so laying out a large cell will get expensive very quickly.
